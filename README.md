==============

Implementation of a non blocking client accessing the low level API of the [Nakadi event bus](https://github.com/zalando/nakadi). Internally, it uses [Akka](http://akka.io/) and [Akka Http](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/2.0.2/scala/http/) to implement its communication tasks.

Please note that the client provides a Scala as well as a Java interface.
